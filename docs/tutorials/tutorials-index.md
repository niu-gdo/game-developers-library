Tutorials are long-form, nearly step-by-step write ups that readers can follow to recreate a particular outcome, often for the purpose of learning as one follows along.

Our *First Steps* guides on any particular tool are primarily for helping new developers get up to a good starting point from which they can branch out from. We would like to eventually have one for every popular game development tool!
