# Summary

![](./base-res/chpt6-finished-base-project.gif)

In this game jam template, we'll teach you how to build up a 2D top-down game where the player has to dodge or shoot asteroids which will destroy them on contact, with asteroids constantly spawning in from the edges of the screen.

Being a game template, you are highly encouraged to experiment with this foundation and add your own features! Many are suggested at the bottom of the Base Template Tutorial. Speaking of which, get started at the link below:

## Modules

In the future, we will release additional *modules* which are tutorials which will expand upon the base template. You'll find them here when they are available!
