# Unity First Steps Series

## Introduction
Welcome to the Unity First Step Series! This is a collection of guides which will show you how to create a very basic game in Unity, starting from pre-installation.

???+ warning "Getting Your Feet Wet!"
    **For an absolutely new beginner to game development, I *highly* recommend you take a detour to Unity's *Roll-a-Ball* tutorial project**. It is a great first step for anyone's first game, and this guide will not be trying to reinvent that wheel.

    [Roll-a-Ball Tutorial Project](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball?uv=2019.4)  

    Instead, this tutorial will introduce you to some more **intermediate techniques** that will allow you to springboard into other more complex tutorials out there.

    Know how to program, but not familiar with C#? [Read Unity's article on C# programming](https://unity.com/how-to/learning-c-sharp-unity-beginners) to get up to speed. It is pretty easier to learn if you are familiar with C++ or Java.

### Rocket Runner

In the basic runner-style game you will be making, the player will constantly move forward while strafing horizontally to collect missile points and dodge hazards.

Additionally, the player must collect enough missiles to be able to destroy *kill-walls* along their path, or their run will end.

Later parts of this tutorial will act as *modules*, where we use the game as a basis to experiment with some more specific game development concepts.
