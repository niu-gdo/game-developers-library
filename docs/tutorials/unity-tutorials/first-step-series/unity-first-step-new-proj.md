# Create a New Unity Project
*By Jake Rogers*

## Introduction
After [installing Unity](./unity-first-step-install.md), we can create a new project through Unity Hub. Let's make a new project for our runner game.

## Project Creation Menu
In Unity Hub, click 'New Project' from the 'Projects' tab.

At the top, you can select your installed editor version in case you have multiple installations. Pick the most recent LTS version.

Unity comes with some templates for new projects you can select, each one giving you a clean slate or jumping-off-point for prototyping a particular type of game. 

### Pick a Template
For our runner game, we will simply pick the 3D (URP) template.

On the right side, pick a name for your project. I call the project *Rocket Runner*, but feel free to name it what you wish.

You can also pick a directory (or file path) for your project. I recommend changing it to a fast drive on your system, such as an SSD or M.2 drive. Unity has a reputation for being quite hefty to load.

When you're ready, press 'Create Project' and your project will be initialized for you. The first load will take a little bit longer than subsequent loads.

## Conclusion
You now have a new playground to mess around in, time to get to work! \o/

Now is a good time to view our article on acquainting yourself with the Unity Editor! Or, move straight into the runner game series.
