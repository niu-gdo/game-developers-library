## Project Type Support

Unity, like other popular game engines, has support for making many types of games. Here are some brief notes about Unity's ability to make certain types of games.

* **3-D**: 3D has been supported in Unity since its 1.0 release all the way back in 2005! Arguably being a specialty amongst the other game types, you will find no lack of support here. Unity has been used in many high-profile 3D games, such as Escape From Tarkov, Rust, and Risk of Rain 2.

* **2-D**: 2D in Unity has gotten some flak in the past for not being as intuitive as 3D. In fact, you will find that Unity's 2D is obstensibly a 3D game loosely constrained to a single plane. Certain workflow tools for things like tilemapping are not as sophisticated as they are in other 2D capable engines.  
However, most of these concerns come from older posts and threads, as Unity's 2D has come a long way and is very functional. In fact, many of the most popular 2D games are made with Unity, such as RimWorld, Hollow Knight, and Cuphead.

* **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Unity is a very popular choice for Augmented Reality software, where virtual game elements are projected on top of the physical world. [Read More](https://unity.com/unity/features/ar)

* **Virtual Reality (VR)**: Many of the most popular VR games are made with Unity, such as VRChat, Blade & Sorcery, Beat Saber, and BONEWORKS. 

* **Non-Game Applications**: Unity can also be used in general as a tool for showcases, interactive visualizations, and simulations. There are likely better tools available for achieving these goals, but it is a nice option if you are already versed in the engine!
