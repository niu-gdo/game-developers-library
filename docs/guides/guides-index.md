# Guides

Compared to articles, guides are more generalized write-ups about an expansive topic. The purpose of them is to provide a reader a wealth of resources and tips they can use to learn about a particular topic.

Guides are **not** long, step-by-step tutorials that readers will recreate on their systems. Instead, they should read like an introductory lecture on the given topic by providing insight on the topic and showing how the provided links and resources can help readers get up to speed.

For example, a guide on *Procedural Terrain Generation* would give an easily digestable overview on the topic, describing what kind of methods are used for implementation, difficuly, what can be produced from the technique, etc. You would then give **links to other** materials one can use to learn more about the subject.
